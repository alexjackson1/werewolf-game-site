The year is 2130, the COVID-19 pandemic has ravaged the planet, all major civilisation has died out 
and you are part of a township in what was previously known as London, United Kingdom. Your society 
has reverted to the old ways of the world, farming the land for food and accusing people you don't 
like of being witches. 

However, something is not right, members of your town are being eaten in the 
night! The only evidence that remains are some bloody clothes and wolf hairs. Your town has been 
infested with werewolves and you must kill them all before they kill the town's people and make it 
their own!

Luckily, some members of your society possess special gifts that could help you to work out who is 
good and who is bad. Be careful though, you don't know whether revealing your gifts could help the 
town, or just lead to your untimely demise!

Before playing, please familiarise yourself with the rules, roles, and characteristics.
