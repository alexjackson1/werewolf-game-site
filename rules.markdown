## Background 
The game proceeds in days and nights, most of the activity takes place on the evening of any given 
day at `21.00 GMT+1` (London time). The game starts on **Wednesday the 1st April 2020** and it is 
expected to last between 5-10 days. There are **two teams** playing: the good team, and the bad 
team. The winning conditions for the two teams are as follows:
 - The good team win if and only if they survive one night without any members of the village dying. 
 - The bad team win if either: (1) the number of alive players aligned to the bad team equals the 
   number of players aligned to the good team, or (2) the town dies of starvation (werewolves can 
   continue to eat corpses). 

_**Advice for new players, in particular:** this is a social and logical deduction game where roles 
are hidden from most players. The wolves, in general, must try and keep their identities hidden and 
may want to lie about their role. If the villagers discover (or have reason to believe) someone is a
wolf, they will likely lynch that person and probably won’t take them seriously in the discussion. 
**It is allowed to lie, be honest, talk nonsense, say absolutely nothing.**_

### Night-Time Game Play 
Each night the werewolves decide who amongst the town will be killed (this will be done by majority vote of the werewolves – in the event of a tie there will be a random casting vote allocated). The night is also when special roles will be activated. In order to decide which player the werewolves will eat, they are allowed a **5-minute chat prior to the voting window**. The werewolves must submit their votes by 13.00 each day (the player they select will have been eaten the previous night in the game). 

### Evening-Time Game Play 
Each evening the people of the town (including the werewolves) must decide who amongst them they will lynch, with the aim of trying to kill all the werewolves before it is too late. This will be done via a **30-minute WhatsApp conversation** involving everyone in the town (if they wish to participate). The decision will be made by a simple majority vote of all players.  

There will be **two rounds of voting** when deciding who to lynch: a **preliminary** round and a **final** round. In the event of a tie in the final round of voting, a casting vote will be assigned randomly. Votes for the preliminary round can be submitted between `21.14` and `21.16` and the results will be announced at `21.20`. Votes for the final round need to be submitted by `21.30` when all conversation must stop. The results of the final round and, ultimately, the lynching of a player will be announced shortly afterwards. If you miss the window to vote, you will be marked as abstaining. **The moderator’s decision is final on whether to accept votes submitted after the voting window closes.** 

**YOU MUST NOT DISCUSS ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE GAME OUTSIDE THE 30 MINUTE WINDOW, UNLESS YOU HAVE BEEN INSTRUCTED TO DO SO BY THE MODERATOR.**

### Additional Rules and Notes
In addition to the above rules, please bear in mind the following additional notes:
 - Ask any questions which reveal your role in a private chat with the moderator, obviously. 
 - Please be kind to one another, I know you are all great people but remember it is easy to miss obvious things and it is also easy to get frustrated: do not vent your frustration on other people. 
 - If you are killed early, sorry! You will have the opportunity to become omniscient and follow along the game knowing all the secrets. 
 - Everything is decided using pseudo-random number generators using the background radiation of the universe, don’t blame the moderator: blame the seed constant which determines the state of the universe at any one point (fuck you free-willers). 
 - The moderator’s decision is final. Always.
