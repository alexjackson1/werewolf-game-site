title: Roles & Characteristics
permalink: /roles/
---
You have each been assigned a role and, potentially, a characteristic. There is no other information about the roles/characteristics provided to the players with these roles. All information here is complete and everyone has the same information about how the game is taking place.  

### Roles 
The following roles have been assigned to a unique player, they each come with certain actions that can be performed. The number in brackets is the number of players who are assigned that role. 

#### Basic Roles
 - **Werewolf (4) — bad team**. Werewolves are known to each other and decide who to kill each night. 
 - **Farmer (5) — good team**. Farmers are not known to each other; they simply sleep during the night and decide who to lynch in the day (the perfect life). 

#### Special Roles
 - **Seer (1) — good team**. The seer can *discover players’ alignment to either team*, they can choose one person each night and the moderator will tell them if they play for the good team or bad team. Otherwise, they play as a farmer. 
 - **Doctor (1) — good team**. The doctor can *treat one player who has been killed* and bring them back to life (modern medicine at its finest). Once they have saved that patient, they can no longer save any more. Otherwise, they play as a farmer. 
 - **Priest (1) — good team**. The priest can *choose one player to protect* during the game. They can choose the player at any point but, once chosen, it cannot be changed until that player has had an attempt on their life.  Otherwise, they play as a farmer. 
 - **Baker (1) — good team**. The baker *chooses one player each night to deliver bread* to in the morning. In doing so, they reveal they are the baker. If the baker dies, the town has three days until all the villagers die of starvation. Otherwise, they play as a farmer. 
 - **Mayor (1) — good team**. The mayor *has an extra vote during town votes*. Otherwise, they play as a farmer. 
 - **Traitor (1) — good/bad team**. The traitor *knows who the werewolves are and will win the game if they win*. To the seer, the traitor appears to be good — but clearly has ulterior motives! Otherwise, they play as a farmer. 

In addition to the actions provided by the roles, the following is also possible and can happen to any player at any time. 
 - **Confession:** each night a player, the confessor, will be chosen at random and will be asked if they would like to confess their role to the priest. If they agree, then the priest will know which role the confessor has. This will include their characteristic. 

### Characteristics 

In addition to the roles assigned to each player, some players may have one or more characteristics. The following characteristics are possible, the numbers in brackets are how many (of which team) are assigned that characteristic. The traitor is a bad player for this assignment. 
 - **Honest (1 bad, 1 good, 1 any):** honest players, when asked if they would like to confess to the priest, *must confess*. 
 - **Brutal (1 good, 1 any):** brutal players, when killed by any means, can *take another player down with them* (kill them). 
 - **Psychic (1 bad, 1 good, 1 any):** every other night psychic players can *ask the moderator a question* of the form: “is `<player>` a `<role|characteristic>`?”. They will receive an answer which is correct 70% the time.
