24 hours. This will include details of the preliminary and final votes (including who was killed), 
details of any special roles that were activated each night, and who the werewolves killed. The 
details will also be posted by the moderator into the WhatsApp chat, this is only to maintain

below.

### Special Roles Record (Night #0)
 - The werewolves killed and ate Alice!
 - Someone saved Alice from certain death!

*Here, the werewolves chose Alice to be killed but someone protected Alice. This could've been the 
doctor (on the night of her death) or the priest (because they had chosen Alice prior to the night).
Note, that only the person the Baker delivers bread to knows that they received bread. Note also 
that the seer does not get mentioned in the special roles record. The traitor has no special actions
so they also do not appear.*

Finally, the remaining players will also be enumerated as follows:
